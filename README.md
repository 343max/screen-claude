# Screenclaude

`screenclaude` will open a new claude code session in a `tmux` (originally: screen) session in the current directory. If a a `screenclaude` session is already running it will just reconnect.

The purpose is to be able to see what claude is up to when you are not in front of your computer. You can use [Termius](https://termius.com) or the ssh client of your choice to log back into your running claude session.
